Bulkaria Documentation Repo
===========================

## Objetive
This repository stores any kind of documentation related to project Bulkaria.

If possible all documents will be written in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics) format.

## Writing Conventions

* Organize documents in folders, naming it in lowercase and uses hyphens for word separation.
* If one folder need a master page, this must be named README.md, because GitHub shows it by default.
* Every file must be named in lowercase and only may contain hyphens and must have extention *.md*
* The links between md documents must be built like:

  ```
  [Text to show](relative-path/file-name.md)
  ```
  
  example
